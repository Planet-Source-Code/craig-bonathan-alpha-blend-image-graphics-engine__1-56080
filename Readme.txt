The Alpha-Blend-Image graphics engine allows you to draw pictures to the screen with variable transparency (see screenshot), and if done correctly, can reduce aliasing so much that it isn't visible. It also prevents graphical glitches, such as flickering, by using a buffer. The engine works particularly well for 2D games, such as the one I am working on now (screenshots included in zip file).

The program to make the .abi files can't be submitted on PSC due to executables not being allowed (I don't intend on giving out the source code). However, if you like the ABI graphics engine, and would like to use it in your own programs (unmodified), you can email me, and I will send you the program, along with the images used to make this demo.
